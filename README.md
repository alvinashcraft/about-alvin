Relatively simple site to showcase my career and skills. My attempt at updating my web skill set.
Thoughts about what is to come:
- Angular 2 and TypeScript
- Some kind of NoSQL for data. Mongo?
- Do all development in VS Code
- Deploy to Azure from GitHub with each commit
- Features
  - About Blurb
  - Dynamic Resume
  - Online projects
  - Awards, associations and social links
  - Personal info (some basic family stuff and background)
  - Admin pages for updating info
  - Contact page
